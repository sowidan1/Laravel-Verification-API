## My OTP Functionality Setup


> **Note**: The OTP functionality relies on [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/) for sending SMS. You will need valid Infobip credentials to fully test this feature. Infobip offers a free trial for testing purposes, but OTPs will only be sent to the registered phone number used during account setup.

# .env file

```bash

INFOBIP_API_KEY=fb64248cac4a1b924e525075215019b6-5d77bb6d-97be-4242-833a-997ab4382096
INFOBIP_BASE_URL=https://e5eyqr.api.infobip.com
INFOBIP_FROM_NUMBER=447491163443
```

This setup will only send messages to the specific phone number registered for testing with Infobip (in this case, 01019465724).


## Skipping OTP Activation

To bypass OTP activation during development or testing, you can use the following steps:

1. Add these values to your `.env` file to configure Infobip:

    ```bash

    INFOBIP_API_KEY=fb64248cac4a1b924e525075215019b6-5d77bb6d-97be-4242-833a-997ab4382096
    INFOBIP_BASE_URL=https://e5eyqr.api.infobip.com
    INFOBIP_FROM_NUMBER=447491163443
    ```

2. In `App/Http/Services/AuthService.php`, uncomment out line 67 to disable the verification requirement:

    ```php
    // $user->update(['is_verified' => User::IS_VERIFIED]);
    ```

This setup allows you to proceed without OTP verification, which is useful for initial testing and development purposes.


## Postman Collection for Testing and Documentation

You can test the API using the following Postman collection:

1. **Import the Collection**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on **Import** in the top left corner.
   - Select **Import From Link**.
   - Paste the following URL:
     
     ```
     https://api.postman.com/collections/27167134-da9f6510-295f-4b03-bfcc-3c680c50f2ed?access_key=PMAT-01JB2WZ3KADBBA05BAK2QTESRC
     ```
